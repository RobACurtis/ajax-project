# Liturgical Calendar

#### A web application for Catholics who want the liturgical cycle of the Church to be a part of their daily life. 

I built this single page CRUD application as part of my journey of learning JavaScript, specifically Asynchronous JavaScript and XML as well as the Document Object Model. I wanted to build this calendar to keep myself updated on the liturgical celebrations throughout the year within the Catholic Church.
